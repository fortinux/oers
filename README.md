The Digital Freedom Foundation (DFF) has transitioned over the past ten years from a marketing events organization to advocate the use of Free Software to an organization which has broaden its scope to digital knowledge in general covering Free Software, Open Hardware and Content (OER, Free culture), and assembled or created all the required pieces to drive an educational project aimed at educating the people in needs.

As a worldwide community with hundreds of local groups and associations taking part in our efforts, we hope to extend our reach to every corner of the world. Please join us by organizing or participating in any of our international days!
